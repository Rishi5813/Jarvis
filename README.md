# Jarvis

Jarvis Is An A.I. and it made using Python, I hope everyone likes It. If you find any bugs or issues, Please
Inform me in the issues corner. I would be glad if you all help me build this great Application. 

You have to install python compiler, Jarvis cannot be compiled without Python installed on your system. If you have Windows operating system, you can install python and dependencies and use pyinstaller to make a .exe file.

First git clone https://github.com/Rishi5813/Jarvis.git, then cd into the Jarvis directory.

Open Terminal in linux and Mac or CMD on Windows.

pip install all these Modules (Remember : Some Modules come already installed with Python).

The Required Dependencies and Modules are :

    1) Speech Recognition
    2) pyaudio (portaudio too) 
    3) pyttsx3
    4) webbrowser
    5) tkcalendar
    6) win10toast
    7) pillow
    8) selenium(The default webdriver is Chromedriver.exe, which means that the application will use Chrome.
       The driver and the code can be rendered for other Browsers)
    9) googlesearch
    10) playsound
    11) wikipedia
    12) pybluez2
    13) pytessaract (tessaract should be istalled, but this module is Optional)
    14) pyautogui
    15) tkinter
    16) os
    17) sys
    18) datetime
    19) time
    
Once the Dependencies are cleared, you should go into the directory and write a command "python Jarvis.py".

After This Jarvis will open a command Window. Now you can use and Give Commands to the A.I., I hope that you all will like
Jarvis. You can give Comments in the issues section, but give a "#comment" tag before the comment.


Thanking You,
Rishi Jani
